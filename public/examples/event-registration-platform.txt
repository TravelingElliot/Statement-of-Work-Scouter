Statement of Work: Event Registration and Check-In Platform

The client is organizing recurring in-person and virtual events with attendance ranging from 50 to 2,000 participants.

The system should allow:

* Online event registration
* Ticketing (free and paid)
* QR-code based check-in at events
* Attendee email notifications

Additional requirements:

* Integration with Zoom for virtual events
* Export attendee data as CSV
* Admin dashboard for event management

The client prioritizes speed to deployment over deep customization. Open-source or SaaS-like solutions that can be extended are preferred.
