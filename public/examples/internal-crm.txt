Statement of Work: Internal CRM for Small Sales Team

We are seeking a lightweight CRM system to replace spreadsheets currently used by our sales team of approximately 15 users.

Core functionality includes:

* Lead and contact management
* Deal tracking with configurable stages
* Notes and activity logging per lead
* Basic reporting (pipeline value, closed deals per month)

Nice-to-have features:

* Email integration (Gmail or Outlook)
* User authentication with role permissions
* Simple dashboard for management

The system should be web-based and accessible internally. The client does not require a highly polished UI but values ease of use. Preference is for open-source software that can be self-hosted.
